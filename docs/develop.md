# Developing Mods

This section covers the two methods of developing mods for R.E.P.O.

## Usage

There are two main ways to develop mods for R.E.P.O.:

- [**Via a HarmonyX Project**](harmonyx.md) 
- [**Via a Patched Unity Project**](unity.md)

Which method to choose depends on your experience level and project scope.
For new modders and smaller projects that don't need any custom scripts, the Unity workflow is recommended.
For more advanced modders or projects requiring custom scripts, the HarmonyX workflow in combination with the Unity Workflow is also recommended. This allows for both custom assets and custom code.
The third option, combining both, is not a separate method but rather a common practice when advanced modding is required. This is why it is not listed as a separate method.
