# R.E.P.O. Unity Project Setup

A guide for setting up your Unity Project to create mods for R.E.P.O.

This Unity workflow streamlines custom content creation.\
By combining the **REPOLib-Sdk** Unity Editor package with the core **REPOLib** DLL, you can build mods entirely without writing code.

While REPOLib isn't strictly mandatory, it is *highly* recommended, **especially** if you are new to the R.E.P.O. modding scene.\
For experienced developers, REPOLib is fully extensible, meaning you can still seamlessly integrate your own custom C# scripts alongside it.

::: info NOTE
The Unity workflow is primarly needed for creating Enemies, Levels, Valuables and Items!

## Setup the Unity Editor

- **Unity Hub:** Download & Install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download).
- **Unity Editor:** Install the Unity Editor version [2022.3.62f3](unityhub://2022.3.62f3/96770f904ca7).
- **.NET SDK**: Version 6.0 or higher. This is required for AssetRipper to Run. 
<!-- NOTE: AssetRipper may be updated with a more Recent build which will Require .Net SDK 10 in the Future -->

## Unity Project Setup

1. Create a new Unity project with the following configuration (See image below):
    * **Editor Version: `2022.3.62f3`**
    * **Project Location:** Local Project
    * **Template:** 3D (Built-In Render Pipeline)

    ```

  - **Unity Project Patcher BepInEx:** BepInEx handler for a Unity Project Patcher project.
    ```bash
    https://github.com/Kesomannen/unity-project-patcher-bepinex.git
    ```

  - **Unity Repo Project Patcher:** Game wrapper that generates a Unity project from R.E.P.O. build for in-editor play.
    ```bash
    https://github.com/ZehsTeam/unity-repo-project-patcher.git
    ```

### Patching the Project

::: info NOTE
**This process WILL take a while and will restart the `Unity Editor` about 4-6 times.\
At the very beginning, you will receive `4` Popups. You can safely click `OK` on each of them.**
:::

6. After the Editor restarts for the final time, a confirmation window will appear indicating the project has been successfully patched. Click **`OK`**.

::: warning Troubleshooting
If you do not see this window, the patching process has failed. Check the Unity Console for more information.
:::

Now that you Unity Project is successfully patched, we recommend adding [the REPOLib-Sdk](./repolib/sdk/start.md) to your project workflow to make the Workflow easier.
